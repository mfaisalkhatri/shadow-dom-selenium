## :question: What is this Repository about?

- This repo contains automation tests for Shadow DOM elements using Selenium WebDriver 4.
- This repo uses Maven as build tool and TestNG testing framework to run the tests.
- Google Chrome's Download Page has been used as a demo page to automate Shadow DOM elements.

## Running the Tests

By default, tests would be running on LambdaTest Platform. 
If you want to run it on your local machine, please update the browser value in `testng.xml` to `chrome` or 
`firefox` and you should be able to run it in local chrome or firefox respectively.

- To run the test from command line use the following command:

    `mvn clean install -Dusername=<LambdaTest username> -DaccessKey<LambdaTest access key>`

- To run the tests using TestNG: 
  1. In the Run Configuration add the LambdaTest username and access key in the VM option as follows:
      `-Dusername=<LambdaTest username> -DaccessKey<LambdaTest access key>`
  2. Right-click on the `testng.xml` file and select `Run '...\testng.xml'`
